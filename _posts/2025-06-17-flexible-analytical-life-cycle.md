title: "A Flexible Analytical Data Life Cycle: Why One Size Doesn’t Fit All"
date: 2025-06-17

In regulated laboratory environments, the integrity of data depends on more than a generic life cycle. Traditional models fail to capture the diverse procedures across analytical workflows.

This article explores the necessity of a **flexible analytical data life cycle**, one that adapts to various processes—whether it's observational testing or spectroscopic analysis. Drawing insights from regulatory guidance and practical examples, it outlines:

- The difference between active and inactive data phases  
- The importance of sample management and preparation  
- Second-person review and short-term retention  
- Why flexibility is key in adapting to specific analytical contexts

Without this adaptability, labs risk data errors, integrity issues, and inefficiencies.
