    "# Activity: Build a decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree model can makes predictions for a target based on multiple features. Because decision trees are used across a wide array of industries, becoming proficient in the process of building one will help you expand your skill set in a widely-applicable way.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you work as a consultant for an airline. The airline is interested in predicting whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience. The airline would like you to construct and evaluate a model that can accomplish this goal. Specifically, they are interested in knowing which features are most important to customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this activity includes survey responses from 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. In a previous activity, you utilized a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline better understand this data. In this activity, your goal will be to utilize a decision tree model to predict whether or not a customer will be satisfied with their flight experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because this activity uses a dataset from the industry, you will need to conduct basic EDA, data cleaning, and other manipulations to prepare the data for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you’ll practice the following skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Importing packages and loading data\n",
    "* Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process\n",
    "* Building a decision tree model \n",
    "* Tuning hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`\n",
    "* Evaluating a decision tree model using a confusion matrix and various other plots"
